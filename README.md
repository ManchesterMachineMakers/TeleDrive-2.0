# TeleDrive 2.0
## TeleDrive 1.0's Sequel. Simple, Fast, Easy.

We have used state of the art frameworks to develop an Electron based Mac OS and Windows App! 

This all-in-one app contains the ability to call using audio and video with your drive team with end-to-end encryption! Rather than having to use Parsec for video, Discord for audio, and the TeleDrive executables for gamepad, everything is though this app making it VERY easy to setup!

This time, the instructions are very simple and there are only two steps: [Installation](https://github.com/innov8rz-ftc-team-11039/TeleDrive-2.0/new/main?readme=1#installation "Go to Installation Section") and [Usage](https://github.com/innov8rz-ftc-team-11039/TeleDrive-2.0/new/main?readme=1#usage "Go to Usage Section")
.

# Installation

## Windows

All you have to do it go to to Releases Tab for the latest release and download `TeleDrive-Windows-x64.zip`.

Then, you simply need to extract the contents of `TeleDrive-Windows-x64.zip`. These steps are shown in the images below.

Once done, move into the folder inside until you see a bunch of files. One of them will be names `TeleDrive.exe`.

## Mac OS

All you have to do it go to to Releases Tab for the latest release and download `TeleDrive-MacOS.zip`.

Then, you simply need to extract the contents of `TeleDrive-MacOS.zip`. These steps are shown in the images below.

# Usage

The User Interface is the same across all platforms, but instructions for Host and Driver are different. 

**There is a section below dedicated to changed that need to be made to the Robot Controller side code.**

## Host

If you are the host, you must be near the robot that you choose to implement TeleDrive on. 

## Driver

Driver setup is very easy! Once you have opened the TeleDrive app on your computer, you should plug in your controller and then click the `Driver` button as shown below.

Now, you can type in your desired Display Name in the text box as well as the room code that the Host should send to you separately (e.g. through Messages or Discord chat). **However, thanks to a special file saving feature, you only need to enter this in once!** (unless the Host decides to regenerate a room code).

Once done, click join room, and you can start driving your robot!

If you are the host, you must be near the robot that you choose to implement TeleDrive on.
